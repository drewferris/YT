What do I get paying for the course for the beginner C# course .. whats the difference from this tutorial and the online course .. anyone of you guys attended this course .. seems worthy since there&#39;s so many great reviews and It&#39;s new years sale now ...﻿

Do yourself a favor and google &quot;Learn C# for beginners Microsoft&quot; and you will find a great video guide for ABSOLUTE beginners (for free, with transcripts and subtitles that actually make sense). I paid for the beginners classes from Mosh and is not as beginners friendly as i was told here.﻿
Need some help here.<br /><br />I want to create apps using Visual Studio but don&#39;t know how to go about doing this.  Most videos skip this step in actually getting the right hardware first.<br /><br />I&#39;m a Linux person and I&#39;m not happy with the MonoDevelop software that runs on Linux that creates Windows C# .exe files that run on a Windows machine (the final customer).  MonoDevelop has too many bugs.<br /><br />I want to get a legitimate, reasonable, and fairly priced Windows 10 operating system installation disc (I assume that will be a CD or DVD or USB thumb drive) to install on a bare-bone brand new workstation of my choice.  I want the install CD/DVDs/USB stick  because I want the capability to do a clean install in the future if I get malware/spyware/viruses on my workstation and the Defender software/anitvirus doesn&#39;t get me back to normal.<br /><br />I stopped by a local computer store and I found out....<br />1) there&#39;s no guarantee any given workstation I might custom design (or purchase from someone else) will run the Windows 10 operating system from a clean install.<br />2) you don&#39;t normally get the install Windows CDs/DVDs/USB thumb drive like you did in the Windows XP era when you buy a new workstation/laptop.<br /><br />What the heck?!<br /><br />I was expecting to buy the best hardware workstation of my choosing and do a clean install using a Windows 10 installation CD/DVD.<br /><br />I do NOT like the idea of not getting the Windows 10 install CD to do a clean install whenever I feel like it.<br /><br />I come from a Linux background whereby I buy whatever workstation hardware setup I like and then do a total clean install (wipe the entire disk space) of the hard drive and install CentOS Linux operating system and I&#39;m fine.<br /><br /><b>*</b>-How are you guys handling this without getting ripped-off/burnt and paying for stuff you don&#39;t need?<br /><br />I already have a keyboard, mouse, and HD monitor.  I just need the base unit.<br /><br />P.S. I know the difference between 32 and 64 bit specs that must be met for Linux/Windows installs, so we don&#39;t have to discuss that aspect.﻿
Ok so you have some specific settings in your visual studio? Because for me your fast mooves are not working. For ex. try+enter , ctrl+click in type.﻿

how long did it take you to get the hang of programming?﻿
im just starting, (yesterday) only 6 hours in. Im having hard time remembering the relationships and order in which each method needs to be placed. Trying to be patient.﻿
Fantastic tutorial! Thank you so much for making this!﻿
it&#39;s vb studio 2015 ?﻿
His udemy course is too short and incomplete. Be aware!!﻿
my visual studios crashes every time i make a new project any one help???﻿
Give me a like if you are a muso who thought C# was regarding my guitars tuning alternative!! I am no longer a computer nerd,though still a nerd, maybe I&#39;ll come back to this great tutorial another day lol!!﻿
Thank you so much for this tutorial. You&#39;ve done an awesome job!! Best Regards!!﻿
are you sure this is for beginners?﻿
I can say that it is a very good tutorial and you helped us to learn too many things in such a short time and so easily.<br />Thank you very much.﻿
Do you have the next video to this?﻿
the firs code you writ (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=17m36s" class="ot-anchor">17:36</a>) didn&#39;t work for me I had to put System.Console.WriteLine instead of Console.WriteLine. ???﻿
Great tutorial. Its my habit to listen to multiple beginner tutorials when I&#39;m first starting a language, because of the different approaches each teacher has to teaching. Your mix of theory and interactivity is nearly perfect. Best beginning C# tutorial I have found online yet!﻿
About 2/3rd s of the way through and this is awesome! Considering taking your course.﻿
Awesome tutorial, thanks﻿

Many Thanks!﻿
How much is the course, do I get a video that I can download and keep for reference, also how many courses and to what stage do you teach? Your basic video is excellent. If the rest of the course is like this then I will enjoy learning.﻿
I started my first semester in Computer Sciences and C# is our first language we learn, it&#39;s been so daunting and crazy, on top of that my teacher teaching got sick and had to be replaced by two other teachers whom have no idea how to teach it to first years as they&#39;re geared more toward 2nd and 3rd year students. I bought all 3 of your lectures on Udemy and within the first 20 minutes you have already showed me and made me understand more than i have learned in the past 3 months. Thank you so much.﻿
My visual studio has different appearance, it&#39;s with white background... how can I get the same look as yours? my eyes hurt after a while programming :/﻿
If I buy your course. Will I come back in like years and still have an access to it to refresh my memory?﻿
Clear and Appropriate... Cannot find a better tutorial for c# across the whole of youtube.... Thanks a Lot!﻿

This is gonna help me, im trying to develop my own program for personal reasons﻿
I went ahead and purchased you intermediate course.  Very impressed with your courses.﻿
Is there any other platform to buy your courses?﻿
Question to anyone using visual studio for mac - any reason why my terminal window doesn&#39;t pop up when I run &quot;hello world&quot;?  There are a few windows, at the bottom of visual studio, which pop up, but subsequently disappear.  It is if my program has run in silent mode (no terminal).﻿
My mac version I downloaded is a very simplified version of the Visual Studio that you use, Is there a way I can have a more advanced version of visual studio?﻿
Please say me why this code is wrong:<br />        class Gigant<br />        {<br />            public<br />                PictureBox picture=new PictureBox();<br />            public<br />                Gigant ()<br />                {<br />                    picture.Visible = true;<br />                    picture.Image = Image.FromFile(&quot;Gigant.bmp&quot;);<br />                    picture.Top = 100;<br />                    picture.Left = 100;<br />                    picture.Height = 100;<br />                    picture.Width=100;<br />                }<br />            public<br />                void walk(int x)<br />                {<br />                    picture.Top -= x;<br />                }<br />        }<br /><br />        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />        {<br />            Gigant gg = new Gigant();<br />            gg.walk(10);<br />        }<br />When I click the button1, it doesn&#39;t show anythink.

i cant use ALt + Enter, the mean using reach?<br />@programming with mosh﻿
Where is the next video ???????﻿
Great series! Easy to follow and is logical. Thank you.﻿
super Tutorial Thanks Mosh﻿
I really cannot agree with you about using &quot;var&quot; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=36m00s" class="ot-anchor">36:00</a>).  Especially since in your own example you showed how an explicit byte can be converted to a default int. There is no reason NOT to explicitly declare them. Its even better for readability. You see it and have to guess? Or you have to hover the mouse on it? NO! Look at it and see that its declared on the left! When every one is declared (on the left) 100% you never have to guess. I wish &quot;var&quot; was not a thing!<br /><br />I can only half agree when a statement reads &quot;something name = new something(parameters)&quot; I can agree that its redundant and var could be substituted. However, if the convention of naming it on the left is more readable then still I have to disagree. The redundancy is more acceptable to keep the uniformity of declaring things on the left all the time. Just my opinion.﻿
Super good tutorial, THANK YOU SO MUCH!! :)﻿
Best ever !!!﻿
very usefull (y)﻿
where can i download   C#  ?﻿
hi.  is the tutorial accompanied by a manual or is everything on video?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=19m18s" class="ot-anchor">19:18</a><br />it&#39;s pronounced &quot;pie&quot; like the food. not pee﻿
Thanks for the video - good stuff.﻿
thank you for uploading this video........its very helpful. the way of explaining things made easy to understand.... worth purchasing ......﻿
Guess its to complicated for a 15 year old.. I do know web dev like css html javascript etc.... C# wont make sence. I&#39;ve made a ball move with arrow keys but i just wrote i never understod. Fml﻿
you need a shave!.  But it&#39;s an informative video anyway.   anyway... Pi is pronounced like PIE not PEE﻿
that &quot;try&quot; trick didn&#39;t work for me I had to write it my self (Im using VB2015)﻿
Thanks for the tutorial totally understood nd u made me feel that the language is so easy. Thanks again.﻿
it is very useful lesson thanks alot <br />but i have a question when I run the program the black window appear a second and then disappear why!!!???﻿
Mosh, will you be making an updated Asp.net core 1.0 video on Plural Sight? I really liked that first video and would love to see an updated version from yourself and a few other dev&#39;s﻿

You skill are great !! Your explanation is wonderful , but the product Visula studio is not worth it.<br />I have spent 40 mins just to get here . Not user friendly at all﻿
good job bro , I am following you...#﻿
CLR: Calcium, Lime, Rust. Great for those clogged showerheads!﻿
please link next video related to c#﻿
thx for no ads. and THANK YOU for starting from the basics unlike most ppl and teacher﻿
I really enjoyed this lesson and your ways of explaining Mosh, thank you. And since the course has a fairly nice price, I&#39;ll be buying it within the next 10 mins :D. If the lecture-quality is just as good as this one then I will definitely buy your other c# courses as soon as I&#39;m done with this one!﻿
This course is without a doubt the best introduction to C# on YouTube, this course is explained so well that you are able to retain the information unlike other courses that all ways seem to miss crucial points that could help.﻿
Although I know all this stuff for years now, I kept watching till the end, for pure enjoyment of seeing lecture done right. Amazing.﻿
Exceptional tutorial series.  Concise.  Clear.  Good pace.﻿
Gj .You won another sub :D﻿
I have plenty of questions that are going in my head and could you tell about how i make a career in web development by using C# and for which platform should i have to go with for good career growth whether in game development, desktop app or  web development. And last but not least what is C# xamarin stands for and what&#39;s its use in .NET framework. Does C# is the best language in coming years, to start with..???? i would really appreciate if you make one video on it  so that all queries would be clarified.﻿
Great tutorial thanks! Weird but when I ctrl+click on a keyword to bring up the object browser, nothing happens. I have to ctrl+alt+J to bring up the object browser, but that does not highlight the keyword selected. Any ideas?﻿
It is missing correct subtitles for Deaf programmers audience :(﻿
In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=31m34s" class="ot-anchor">31:34</a> by saying in C#, do you actually mean C# compiler? Beacuse actually C# language itself is only a specification, and it is implemented or energised in compiler.﻿
Which tools do you use for code completion?﻿
wow this is the best tutorial ever, cant believe i learned c# within an hour but i struggle a bit running the code because im using linux. but the rest was easy thanks to mosh.﻿
string is a  reference type right?﻿
is Primitive type same as Value type ?﻿
what font is in your slides?﻿
This is really good, thank you! You cover a lot more than other C# tutorials..﻿
You&#39;re great at explaining things!﻿
well done man, good work with your figures, helps visualization so well!!﻿
Thanks you are very candid at explaining things. I enjoyed your C# tutorial﻿
How long will the course be 70% off with the code? I really would like to get it for that price but it might be a few days. :/ Thank you for this video, I can not wait to dive into to C#. :)﻿
Love your videos! I&#39;m a junior programmer analyst and going through your videos kinda helped me understand a bit better how to handle the tasks I&#39;m assigned to at work. You teach better than most of my teachers in university! Wish you could have been the teacher in all my programming classes haha Keep those videos coming! Again, thank you :)﻿
Hi Mosh, it is very lucky to find such a great c# tutorial like yours! is it the complete course for your first C# basics? i want to join and learn your video course, how can i paid you and get the complete version?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m53s" class="ot-anchor">37:53</a> nothing happened.The soliution browser didn&#39;t open. Help!﻿
Thanks much for these videos..very helpful..i have few basic questions..1)is string a non primitive data type?2)class, structure and enum what kind of data type they come under primitive or non primitive3)difference between primitive and non primitive are primitive is pre defined and non primitive is user definedam I right..?thanks again﻿
Thank you for the amazing tutorials! I have only watched the first part so far, but I already feel motivated to continue unlike with other languages. I only do this as a hobby, and I currently only have very low-level programming skills for retro development only(650x family processors&#39; ASM, Z80 and Intel 8080 ASM). However, I both need to make myself tools and also take a step forward in time, and so far C# seems like a nice entry point for me :)﻿
My visual studio does not have console in it. What shall I do?﻿
I&#39;m interested in buying course on Udemy but I&#39;m Mac user.  There is no full-featured Visual Studio for Mac. Can I use Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio Code? Or will I miss a lot from course using these tools?﻿
Hey! Love the tutorial, will definitely purchase the full course. Was just wondering though, isn&#39;t it easier (generally speaking) to read the code if &quot;correct&quot; type is used instead of &quot;var&quot;? Personally i find it easier and faster to read the code with strings named string, ints named int etc. Thoughts?﻿
This is amazing... one of the best tuts I&#39;ve seen.  I will be sharing.   I would say this tho, one of the more confusing concepts for beginners is return type/output of method.  Its contradictory in description... how can something go out and return?  Return to what? LOL That tripped me up when I was getting started.﻿
Thanks so much sir﻿
+programming with Mosh will u advise to us a book for beginners(c#) ?﻿
Hey mosh i Need your help Please <br />First thanks , second iam going to buy the course , But why dont you have Tutorials<br />on &quot;Windows form &quot; or &quot;UI with buttons and textboxs ....etc&quot; I mean isnt that the important stuff !<br />when making a program its all about the UI and and the program can do ..???<br />Third , Could you Please tell me where i can get course&#39;s like that using windows form ?﻿
Great tutorial, btw pi is pronounced as pie!﻿
KInda of cool but will let yah know as tym flow﻿
As an intermediate C# programmer this is helped me a lot! Thank you!<br />In addition, I am looking for up-to-date learning material about WPF with C#, do you know where I can find any?﻿
Wow, I feel so relieved to find these tutorials. I was dead scared to start learning the language until this video. I totally understand everything you teach and more importantly increased my confidence. I&#39;m considering purchasing the extra material. Thank you for the good work﻿
Audio is so choppy it&#39;s difficult to listen to this video. Please re make it, and upload it again. Thanks!﻿
explicit﻿
Thanks a ton!! :)﻿
Hey man honestly just wanted to say the way you are teaching this, you need a job at my university 😂 well done man keep it up.﻿

Ok, I enjoyed this video! Now my goal is to learn C# as well as ASP.net and learn to make a web site that incorporates a secure user login should the user want to leave comments. Is there is a better course to start this process? I would presume that learning the basics would come first. Does this course satisfy that goal?﻿
would I be able to have a decent grasp of c# within a month&#39;s time if I keep up with these videos?﻿
the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen﻿
you have only one video for c#what about non primitive type ?   Is it paid ?﻿
Thank you!﻿
&quot;90% of the stuff you see here you will never use&quot; thanks for clarifying VS in one sentence LOL.﻿
I know next to nothing about programming, so I hope these will help~ <b>Subscribes</b><br />Edit: Well I watched the whole video, and I can tell that I know much more now than I did before watching. I bought your course on Udemy. Very efficient learning so far, and I&#39;m highly considering buying the course and also requesting this tutorial to my peers if ever~﻿
This is really the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen, highly considering purchasing the course﻿
You are the best teacher ever. Hats off to you , Let me know where else I can follow you so I can tell my class fellows too.﻿
Hello, I am using a mac. My visual studio does not look like yours? Is there a reason why?﻿

Help me out.﻿
Wow, finally somebody who knows how to pronounce &quot;pi&quot; correctly!  OK, that&#39;s a useless comment for your great contribution, here, Mr. Mosh.  I will try to add at least one useful thing, then:<br /><br />In the new C# 6, the string placeholders can be written like this, which can be a little cleaner:<br />Console.WriteLine($&quot;{byte.MinValue} {byte.MaxValue}&quot;)<br /><br />Cf. the example at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=39m35s" class="ot-anchor">39:35</a>.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your time and knowledge!﻿
Thank you so much this helped me sharpen my skills and knowledge in C# after programming <a href="http://VB.NET" class="ot-anchor">VB.NET</a> for 2 years. I have a job interview for a .NET Developer position on Friday and without having any professional NET Development experience and only freelance experience this really should help me. They&#39;re looking for an entry-level developer and they&#39;re well aware I don&#39;t have a college degree and that I still have stuff to learn. Hopefully I land the job. Thanks so much you&#39;ve totally eased my mind!﻿
Great Tutorials covering the scope and also details!﻿

it is very useful to beginner.﻿

Thank you.  I enjoyed your video. I am struggling a little with knowing how to start writing the code from scratch.  Currently I am learning to build micro services, web services, APIs, Messaging etc for the job I am in.  They have given me ample time to learn C# but I am struggling to contribute as much as I would like to.﻿
Thank you for the video. it&#39;s very helpful ! =))﻿
Thank You so much for the time efficient tips. Many programming tutorials assume that they have an audience with the same level of efficiency and therefore move far faster. You move at a reasonable pace allowing me to move alongside you and learn. Please keep up the great videos I hope you build a subscriber base so you can continue putting out free content with some kind of compensation for your time. Best of luck to you.﻿
Whats the difference with the paid video and this one if I may ask?﻿
Very professional ! and No words to explain very good in teaching ! Thanks for hard work !﻿
Hi Mosh so I am about a year out from earning my BS in Computer Science but I feel like I am still quite limited on generating code. Up this point the majority of my work has been done manipulating code, or basing projects from examples. Do you have any tips or methods on how to structure a program . I always assume it just comes with experience but it is one of my major problems coding. I&#39;d be interested in seeing some more of your courses as well can you message me some info ? Thanks This video is great by the way :)﻿
nice tutorial﻿
Isn&#39;t overflow the problem they had with Gandhi in Civilisation?﻿
Could you tell me where I could find a website where every command in C# is documented? Great video.﻿

amazing lecture. but being broke i can&#39;t afford the 20$ for your coarse.﻿
Hi i need to create a windows from application can anyone direct me to a website or someone that can help me﻿
Dear Mosh, your lessons at Udemy don&#39;t have captions?﻿
You make it really easy to understand... a really great teacher... do you have JavaScript course?﻿
Although I  have advanced a bit in C# I liked the way you explained some stuffs that were new to me.  I just love you!﻿
Is this from your C# beginner course from Udemy?﻿
Thanks Mosh! great video﻿
Great﻿
I don&#39;t know anything about programming but want to learn programming. Would C # be a good starter package?﻿
Thanks, Mosh. Ease video, I do know how to code in other languages but this video, even if its basic, was pleasant to see :)<br />I&#39;m starting to learn C# because all the new UWP apps :)﻿
Amazing lecture Mosh. Thank you for sharing part of it. I will surely check your lectures at udemy. :)﻿

Ok so you have some specific settings in your visual studio? Because for me your fast mooves are not working. For ex. try+enter , ctrl+click in type.﻿

how long did it take you to get the hang of programming?﻿
im just starting, (yesterday) only 6 hours in. Im having hard time remembering the relationships and order in which each method needs to be placed. Trying to be patient.﻿
Fantastic tutorial! Thank you so much for making this!﻿
it&#39;s vb studio 2015 ?﻿
His udemy course is too short and incomplete. Be aware!!﻿
my visual studios crashes every time i make a new project any one help???﻿
Give me a like if you are a muso who thought C# was regarding my guitars tuning alternative!! I am no longer a computer nerd,though still a nerd, maybe I&#39;ll come back to this great tutorial another day lol!!﻿
Thank you so much for this tutorial. You&#39;ve done an awesome job!! Best Regards!!﻿
are you sure this is for beginners?﻿
I can say that it is a very good tutorial and you helped us to learn too many things in such a short time and so easily.<br />Thank you very much.﻿
Do you have the next video to this?﻿
the firs code you writ (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=17m36s" class="ot-anchor">17:36</a>) didn&#39;t work for me I had to put System.Console.WriteLine instead of Console.WriteLine. ???﻿
Great tutorial. Its my habit to listen to multiple beginner tutorials when I&#39;m first starting a language, because of the different approaches each teacher has to teaching. Your mix of theory and interactivity is nearly perfect. Best beginning C# tutorial I have found online yet!﻿
About 2/3rd s of the way through and this is awesome! Considering taking your course.﻿
Awesome tutorial, thanks﻿

Best C# for beginners on tube..﻿
Many Thanks!﻿
How much is the course, do I get a video that I can download and keep for reference, also how many courses and to what stage do you teach? Your basic video is excellent. If the rest of the course is like this then I will enjoy learning.﻿
I started my first semester in Computer Sciences and C# is our first language we learn, it&#39;s been so daunting and crazy, on top of that my teacher teaching got sick and had to be replaced by two other teachers whom have no idea how to teach it to first years as they&#39;re geared more toward 2nd and 3rd year students. I bought all 3 of your lectures on Udemy and within the first 20 minutes you have already showed me and made me understand more than i have learned in the past 3 months. Thank you so much.﻿
My visual studio has different appearance, it&#39;s with white background... how can I get the same look as yours? my eyes hurt after a while programming :/﻿
If I buy your course. Will I come back in like years and still have an access to it to refresh my memory?﻿
Clear and Appropriate... Cannot find a better tutorial for c# across the whole of youtube.... Thanks a Lot!﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m50s" class="ot-anchor">37:50</a> how do you did that ? control and what click ?﻿
This is gonna help me, im trying to develop my own program for personal reasons﻿
I went ahead and purchased you intermediate course.  Very impressed with your courses.﻿
Is there any other platform to buy your courses?﻿
Question to anyone using visual studio for mac - any reason why my terminal window doesn&#39;t pop up when I run &quot;hello world&quot;?  There are a few windows, at the bottom of visual studio, which pop up, but subsequently disappear.  It is if my program has run in silent mode (no terminal).﻿
My mac version I downloaded is a very simplified version of the Visual Studio that you use, Is there a way I can have a more advanced version of visual studio?﻿
Please say me why this code is wrong:<br />        class Gigant<br />        {<br />            public<br />                PictureBox picture=new PictureBox();<br />            public<br />                Gigant ()<br />                {<br />                    picture.Visible = true;<br />                    picture.Image = Image.FromFile(&quot;Gigant.bmp&quot;);<br />                    picture.Top = 100;<br />                    picture.Left = 100;<br />                    picture.Height = 100;<br />                    picture.Width=100;<br />                }<br />            public<br />                void walk(int x)<br />                {<br />                    picture.Top -= x;<br />                }<br />        }<br /><br />        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />        {<br />            Gigant gg = new Gigant();<br />            gg.walk(10);<br />        }<br />When I click the button1, it doesn&#39;t show anythink.

You made it  simple thanks﻿
Nice tutorial.I got a great understanding of what to do and how to do.This video provides me a strong foundation(basement) of c# basic programming.What&#39;s next video&#39;s url .I have some problems so icannot buy the course if you have next step (<del>-</del>&gt;) of c# tutorial. please comment the url of next vide:D.

i cant use ALt + Enter, the mean using reach?<br />@programming with mosh﻿
Where is the next video ???????﻿
Great series! Easy to follow and is logical. Thank you.﻿
super Tutorial Thanks Mosh﻿
I really cannot agree with you about using &quot;var&quot; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=36m00s" class="ot-anchor">36:00</a>).  Especially since in your own example you showed how an explicit byte can be converted to a default int. There is no reason NOT to explicitly declare them. Its even better for readability. You see it and have to guess? Or you have to hover the mouse on it? NO! Look at it and see that its declared on the left! When every one is declared (on the left) 100% you never have to guess. I wish &quot;var&quot; was not a thing!<br /><br />I can only half agree when a statement reads &quot;something name = new something(parameters)&quot; I can agree that its redundant and var could be substituted. However, if the convention of naming it on the left is more readable then still I have to disagree. The redundancy is more acceptable to keep the uniformity of declaring things on the left all the time. Just my opinion.﻿
Super good tutorial, THANK YOU SO MUCH!! :)﻿
Best ever !!!﻿
very usefull (y)﻿
where can i download   C#  ?﻿
hi.  is the tutorial accompanied by a manual or is everything on video?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=19m18s" class="ot-anchor">19:18</a><br />it&#39;s pronounced &quot;pie&quot; like the food. not pee﻿
Thanks for the video - good stuff.﻿
thank you for uploading this video........its very helpful. the way of explaining things made easy to understand.... worth purchasing ......﻿
Guess its to complicated for a 15 year old.. I do know web dev like css html javascript etc.... C# wont make sence. I&#39;ve made a ball move with arrow keys but i just wrote i never understod. Fml﻿
you need a shave!.  But it&#39;s an informative video anyway.   anyway... Pi is pronounced like PIE not PEE﻿
that &quot;try&quot; trick didn&#39;t work for me I had to write it my self (Im using VB2015)﻿
Thanks for the tutorial totally understood nd u made me feel that the language is so easy. Thanks again.﻿
it is very useful lesson thanks alot <br />but i have a question when I run the program the black window appear a second and then disappear why!!!???﻿
Mosh, will you be making an updated Asp.net core 1.0 video on Plural Sight? I really liked that first video and would love to see an updated version from yourself and a few other dev&#39;s﻿
IL is same as JVM ...? they generate both byte codesss?﻿
Great tutorial for beginners! Thanks!﻿

You skill are great !! Your explanation is wonderful , but the product Visula studio is not worth it.<br />I have spent 40 mins just to get here . Not user friendly at all﻿
good job bro , I am following you...#﻿
CLR: Calcium, Lime, Rust. Great for those clogged showerheads!﻿
please link next video related to c#﻿
thx for no ads. and THANK YOU for starting from the basics unlike most ppl and teacher﻿
I really enjoyed this lesson and your ways of explaining Mosh, thank you. And since the course has a fairly nice price, I&#39;ll be buying it within the next 10 mins :D. If the lecture-quality is just as good as this one then I will definitely buy your other c# courses as soon as I&#39;m done with this one!﻿
This course is without a doubt the best introduction to C# on YouTube, this course is explained so well that you are able to retain the information unlike other courses that all ways seem to miss crucial points that could help.﻿
Although I know all this stuff for years now, I kept watching till the end, for pure enjoyment of seeing lecture done right. Amazing.﻿
Exceptional tutorial series.  Concise.  Clear.  Good pace.﻿
Gj .You won another sub :D﻿
I have plenty of questions that are going in my head and could you tell about how i make a career in web development by using C# and for which platform should i have to go with for good career growth whether in game development, desktop app or  web development. And last but not least what is C# xamarin stands for and what&#39;s its use in .NET framework. Does C# is the best language in coming years, to start with..???? i would really appreciate if you make one video on it  so that all queries would be clarified.﻿
Great tutorial thanks! Weird but when I ctrl+click on a keyword to bring up the object browser, nothing happens. I have to ctrl+alt+J to bring up the object browser, but that does not highlight the keyword selected. Any ideas?﻿
It is missing correct subtitles for Deaf programmers audience :(﻿
In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=31m34s" class="ot-anchor">31:34</a> by saying in C#, do you actually mean C# compiler? Beacuse actually C# language itself is only a specification, and it is implemented or energised in compiler.﻿
Which tools do you use for code completion?﻿
wow this is the best tutorial ever, cant believe i learned c# within an hour but i struggle a bit running the code because im using linux. but the rest was easy thanks to mosh.﻿
string is a  reference type right?﻿
is Primitive type same as Value type ?﻿
what font is in your slides?﻿
This is really good, thank you! You cover a lot more than other C# tutorials..﻿
You&#39;re great at explaining things!﻿
well done man, good work with your figures, helps visualization so well!!﻿
Thanks you are very candid at explaining things. I enjoyed your C# tutorial﻿
How long will the course be 70% off with the code? I really would like to get it for that price but it might be a few days. :/ Thank you for this video, I can not wait to dive into to C#. :)﻿
Love your videos! I&#39;m a junior programmer analyst and going through your videos kinda helped me understand a bit better how to handle the tasks I&#39;m assigned to at work. You teach better than most of my teachers in university! Wish you could have been the teacher in all my programming classes haha Keep those videos coming! Again, thank you :)﻿
Hi Mosh, it is very lucky to find such a great c# tutorial like yours! is it the complete course for your first C# basics? i want to join and learn your video course, how can i paid you and get the complete version?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m53s" class="ot-anchor">37:53</a> nothing happened.The soliution browser didn&#39;t open. Help!﻿
Thanks much for these videos..very helpful..i have few basic questions..1)is string a non primitive data type?2)class, structure and enum what kind of data type they come under primitive or non primitive3)difference between primitive and non primitive are primitive is pre defined and non primitive is user definedam I right..?thanks again﻿
Thank you for the amazing tutorials! I have only watched the first part so far, but I already feel motivated to continue unlike with other languages. I only do this as a hobby, and I currently only have very low-level programming skills for retro development only(650x family processors&#39; ASM, Z80 and Intel 8080 ASM). However, I both need to make myself tools and also take a step forward in time, and so far C# seems like a nice entry point for me :)﻿
My visual studio does not have console in it. What shall I do?﻿
I&#39;m interested in buying course on Udemy but I&#39;m Mac user.  There is no full-featured Visual Studio for Mac. Can I use Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio Code? Or will I miss a lot from course using these tools?﻿
Hey! Love the tutorial, will definitely purchase the full course. Was just wondering though, isn&#39;t it easier (generally speaking) to read the code if &quot;correct&quot; type is used instead of &quot;var&quot;? Personally i find it easier and faster to read the code with strings named string, ints named int etc. Thoughts?﻿
This is amazing... one of the best tuts I&#39;ve seen.  I will be sharing.   I would say this tho, one of the more confusing concepts for beginners is return type/output of method.  Its contradictory in description... how can something go out and return?  Return to what? LOL That tripped me up when I was getting started.﻿
Thanks so much sir﻿
+programming with Mosh will u advise to us a book for beginners(c#) ?﻿
Hey mosh i Need your help Please <br />First thanks , second iam going to buy the course , But why dont you have Tutorials<br />on &quot;Windows form &quot; or &quot;UI with buttons and textboxs ....etc&quot; I mean isnt that the important stuff !<br />when making a program its all about the UI and and the program can do ..???<br />Third , Could you Please tell me where i can get course&#39;s like that using windows form ?﻿
Great tutorial, btw pi is pronounced as pie!﻿
KInda of cool but will let yah know as tym flow﻿
As an intermediate C# programmer this is helped me a lot! Thank you!<br />In addition, I am looking for up-to-date learning material about WPF with C#, do you know where I can find any?﻿
Wow, I feel so relieved to find these tutorials. I was dead scared to start learning the language until this video. I totally understand everything you teach and more importantly increased my confidence. I&#39;m considering purchasing the extra material. Thank you for the good work﻿
Audio is so choppy it&#39;s difficult to listen to this video. Please re make it, and upload it again. Thanks!﻿
explicit﻿
Thanks a ton!! :)﻿
Hey man honestly just wanted to say the way you are teaching this, you need a job at my university 😂 well done man keep it up.﻿

Ok, I enjoyed this video! Now my goal is to learn C# as well as ASP.net and learn to make a web site that incorporates a secure user login should the user want to leave comments. Is there is a better course to start this process? I would presume that learning the basics would come first. Does this course satisfy that goal?﻿
would I be able to have a decent grasp of c# within a month&#39;s time if I keep up with these videos?﻿
the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen﻿
you have only one video for c#what about non primitive type ?   Is it paid ?﻿
Thank you!﻿
&quot;90% of the stuff you see here you will never use&quot; thanks for clarifying VS in one sentence LOL.﻿
I know next to nothing about programming, so I hope these will help~ <b>Subscribes</b><br />Edit: Well I watched the whole video, and I can tell that I know much more now than I did before watching. I bought your course on Udemy. Very efficient learning so far, and I&#39;m highly considering buying the course and also requesting this tutorial to my peers if ever~﻿
This is really the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen, highly considering purchasing the course﻿
You are the best teacher ever. Hats off to you , Let me know where else I can follow you so I can tell my class fellows too.﻿
Hello, I am using a mac. My visual studio does not look like yours? Is there a reason why?﻿

Hi Mosh, I love the way you make and explain your tutorials. Do you have C++ videos ? Thanks.﻿
This is an awesome video! I am hopefully starting a Software Development course in college after the summer break, this video helped a lot! I&#39;ll be sure to recommend to my classmates.﻿

Help me out.﻿
Wow, finally somebody who knows how to pronounce &quot;pi&quot; correctly!  OK, that&#39;s a useless comment for your great contribution, here, Mr. Mosh.  I will try to add at least one useful thing, then:<br /><br />In the new C# 6, the string placeholders can be written like this, which can be a little cleaner:<br />Console.WriteLine($&quot;{byte.MinValue} {byte.MaxValue}&quot;)<br /><br />Cf. the example at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=39m35s" class="ot-anchor">39:35</a>.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your time and knowledge!﻿
Thank you so much this helped me sharpen my skills and knowledge in C# after programming <a href="http://VB.NET" class="ot-anchor">VB.NET</a> for 2 years. I have a job interview for a .NET Developer position on Friday and without having any professional NET Development experience and only freelance experience this really should help me. They&#39;re looking for an entry-level developer and they&#39;re well aware I don&#39;t have a college degree and that I still have stuff to learn. Hopefully I land the job. Thanks so much you&#39;ve totally eased my mind!﻿
Great Tutorials covering the scope and also details!﻿
I want to learn c sharp dear sir but how to do it﻿
it is very useful to beginner.﻿
After Learning this what more can i learn about c#?<br />To improve my c# knowledge﻿
I guess I will just take your course because jumping from video to video is exactly what I had been doing.﻿
Thank you.  I enjoyed your video. I am struggling a little with knowing how to start writing the code from scratch.  Currently I am learning to build micro services, web services, APIs, Messaging etc for the job I am in.  They have given me ample time to learn C# but I am struggling to contribute as much as I would like to.﻿
Thank you for the video. it&#39;s very helpful ! =))﻿
Thank You so much for the time efficient tips. Many programming tutorials assume that they have an audience with the same level of efficiency and therefore move far faster. You move at a reasonable pace allowing me to move alongside you and learn. Please keep up the great videos I hope you build a subscriber base so you can continue putting out free content with some kind of compensation for your time. Best of luck to you.﻿
Whats the difference with the paid video and this one if I may ask?﻿
Very professional ! and No words to explain very good in teaching ! Thanks for hard work !﻿
Hi Mosh so I am about a year out from earning my BS in Computer Science but I feel like I am still quite limited on generating code. Up this point the majority of my work has been done manipulating code, or basing projects from examples. Do you have any tips or methods on how to structure a program . I always assume it just comes with experience but it is one of my major problems coding. I&#39;d be interested in seeing some more of your courses as well can you message me some info ? Thanks This video is great by the way :)﻿
nice tutorial﻿
Isn&#39;t overflow the problem they had with Gandhi in Civilisation?﻿
Could you tell me where I could find a website where every command in C# is documented? Great video.﻿

How long is the actual course on your website?﻿
amazing lecture. but being broke i can&#39;t afford the 20$ for your coarse.﻿
Hi i need to create a windows from application can anyone direct me to a website or someone that can help me﻿
Dear Mosh, your lessons at Udemy don&#39;t have captions?﻿
You make it really easy to understand... a really great teacher... do you have JavaScript course?﻿
Although I  have advanced a bit in C# I liked the way you explained some stuffs that were new to me.  I just love you!﻿
Is this from your C# beginner course from Udemy?﻿
Thanks Mosh! great video﻿
Great﻿
I don&#39;t know anything about programming but want to learn programming. Would C # be a good starter package?﻿
Thanks, Mosh. Ease video, I do know how to code in other languages but this video, even if its basic, was pleasant to see :)<br />I&#39;m starting to learn C# because all the new UWP apps :)﻿
Amazing lecture Mosh. Thank you for sharing part of it. I will surely check your lectures at udemy. :)﻿

What do I get paying for the course for the beginner C# course .. whats the difference from this tutorial and the online course .. anyone of you guys attended this course .. seems worthy since there&#39;s so many great reviews and It&#39;s new years sale now ...﻿

Do yourself a favor and google &quot;Learn C# for beginners Microsoft&quot; and you will find a great video guide for ABSOLUTE beginners (for free, with transcripts and subtitles that actually make sense). I paid for the beginners classes from Mosh and is not as beginners friendly as i was told here.﻿

very nice explain in amazing﻿
how long did it take you to get the hang of programming?﻿
im just starting, (yesterday) only 6 hours in. Im having hard time remembering the relationships and order in which each method needs to be placed. Trying to be patient.﻿
Fantastic tutorial! Thank you so much for making this!﻿
it&#39;s vb studio 2015 ?﻿
His udemy course is too short and incomplete. Be aware!!﻿
my visual studios crashes every time i make a new project any one help???﻿
Give me a like if you are a muso who thought C# was regarding my guitars tuning alternative!! I am no longer a computer nerd,though still a nerd, maybe I&#39;ll come back to this great tutorial another day lol!!﻿
Thank you so much for this tutorial. You&#39;ve done an awesome job!! Best Regards!!﻿
are you sure this is for beginners?﻿
I can say that it is a very good tutorial and you helped us to learn too many things in such a short time and so easily.<br />Thank you very much.﻿
Do you have the next video to this?﻿
the firs code you writ (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=17m36s" class="ot-anchor">17:36</a>) didn&#39;t work for me I had to put System.Console.WriteLine instead of Console.WriteLine. ???﻿
Great tutorial. Its my habit to listen to multiple beginner tutorials when I&#39;m first starting a language, because of the different approaches each teacher has to teaching. Your mix of theory and interactivity is nearly perfect. Best beginning C# tutorial I have found online yet!﻿
About 2/3rd s of the way through and this is awesome! Considering taking your course.﻿
Awesome tutorial, thanks﻿
can i use atom editor to write c# language app﻿

Best C# for beginners on tube..﻿
Many Thanks!﻿
How much is the course, do I get a video that I can download and keep for reference, also how many courses and to what stage do you teach? Your basic video is excellent. If the rest of the course is like this then I will enjoy learning.﻿
I started my first semester in Computer Sciences and C# is our first language we learn, it&#39;s been so daunting and crazy, on top of that my teacher teaching got sick and had to be replaced by two other teachers whom have no idea how to teach it to first years as they&#39;re geared more toward 2nd and 3rd year students. I bought all 3 of your lectures on Udemy and within the first 20 minutes you have already showed me and made me understand more than i have learned in the past 3 months. Thank you so much.﻿
My visual studio has different appearance, it&#39;s with white background... how can I get the same look as yours? my eyes hurt after a while programming :/﻿
If I buy your course. Will I come back in like years and still have an access to it to refresh my memory?﻿
Clear and Appropriate... Cannot find a better tutorial for c# across the whole of youtube.... Thanks a Lot!﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m50s" class="ot-anchor">37:50</a> how do you did that ? control and what click ?﻿
This is gonna help me, im trying to develop my own program for personal reasons﻿
I went ahead and purchased you intermediate course.  Very impressed with your courses.﻿
Is there any other platform to buy your courses?﻿
Question to anyone using visual studio for mac - any reason why my terminal window doesn&#39;t pop up when I run &quot;hello world&quot;?  There are a few windows, at the bottom of visual studio, which pop up, but subsequently disappear.  It is if my program has run in silent mode (no terminal).﻿
My mac version I downloaded is a very simplified version of the Visual Studio that you use, Is there a way I can have a more advanced version of visual studio?﻿
Please say me why this code is wrong:<br />        class Gigant<br />        {<br />            public<br />                PictureBox picture=new PictureBox();<br />            public<br />                Gigant ()<br />                {<br />                    picture.Visible = true;<br />                    picture.Image = Image.FromFile(&quot;Gigant.bmp&quot;);<br />                    picture.Top = 100;<br />                    picture.Left = 100;<br />                    picture.Height = 100;<br />                    picture.Width=100;<br />                }<br />            public<br />                void walk(int x)<br />                {<br />                    picture.Top -= x;<br />                }<br />        }<br /><br />        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />        {<br />            Gigant gg = new Gigant();<br />            gg.walk(10);<br />        }<br />When I click the button1, it doesn&#39;t show anythink. The Gigant.bmp file&#39;s folder is ok.<br />Help me please!!﻿
You made it  simple thanks﻿
Nice tutorial.I got a great understanding of what to do and how to do.This video provides me a strong foundation(basement) of c# basic programming.What&#39;s next video&#39;s url .I have some problems so icannot buy the course if you have next step (<del>-</del>&gt;) of c# tutorial. please comment the url of next vide:D. If any one else know then comment it.﻿
i cant use ALt + Enter, the mean using reach?<br />@programming with mosh﻿
Where is the next video ???????﻿
Great series! Easy to follow and is logical. Thank you.﻿
super Tutorial Thanks Mosh﻿
I really cannot agree with you about using &quot;var&quot; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=36m00s" class="ot-anchor">36:00</a>).  Especially since in your own example you showed how an explicit byte can be converted to a default int. There is no reason NOT to explicitly declare them. Its even better for readability. You see it and have to guess? Or you have to hover the mouse on it? NO! Look at it and see that its declared on the left! When every one is declared (on the left) 100% you never have to guess. I wish &quot;var&quot; was not a thing!<br /><br />I can only half agree when a statement reads &quot;something name = new something(parameters)&quot; I can agree that its redundant and var could be substituted. However, if the convention of naming it on the left is more readable then still I have to disagree. The redundancy is more acceptable to keep the uniformity of declaring things on the left all the time. Just my opinion.﻿
Super good tutorial, THANK YOU SO MUCH!! :)﻿
Best ever !!!﻿
very usefull (y)﻿
where can i download   C#  ?﻿
hi.  is the tutorial accompanied by a manual or is everything on video?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=19m18s" class="ot-anchor">19:18</a><br />it&#39;s pronounced &quot;pie&quot; like the food. not pee﻿
Thanks for the video - good stuff.﻿
thank you for uploading this video........its very helpful. the way of explaining things made easy to understand.... worth purchasing ......﻿
Guess its to complicated for a 15 year old.. I do know web dev like css html javascript etc.... C# wont make sence. I&#39;ve made a ball move with arrow keys but i just wrote i never understod. Fml﻿
you need a shave!.  But it&#39;s an informative video anyway.   anyway... Pi is pronounced like PIE not PEE﻿
that &quot;try&quot; trick didn&#39;t work for me I had to write it my self (Im using VB2015)﻿
Thanks for the tutorial totally understood nd u made me feel that the language is so easy. Thanks again.﻿
it is very useful lesson thanks alot <br />but i have a question when I run the program the black window appear a second and then disappear why!!!???﻿
Mosh, will you be making an updated Asp.net core 1.0 video on Plural Sight? I really liked that first video and would love to see an updated version from yourself and a few other dev&#39;s﻿
IL is same as JVM ...? they generate both byte codesss?﻿
Great tutorial for beginners! Thanks!﻿
how do you find the min and max value using the ?:<br />plese help thanks in advance﻿
ok but why do i need to type int x = 1  if i can type Console.Writeline(&quot;1&quot;);  ???﻿
Hi everyone. I work software developer and team-lead. If you beginner and you want learn programming (software development) - I can help you completely free. My profit - my spoken English is not very good and you will help me to improve it. In any case, we do not lose anything if we try. If you are interested please contact me.<br />With best regards, Evgeny.﻿
You skill are great !! Your explanation is wonderful , but the product Visula studio is not worth it.<br />I have spent 40 mins just to get here . Not user friendly at all﻿
good job bro , I am following you...#﻿
CLR: Calcium, Lime, Rust. Great for those clogged showerheads!﻿
please link next video related to c#﻿
thx for no ads. and THANK YOU for starting from the basics unlike most ppl and teacher﻿
I really enjoyed this lesson and your ways of explaining Mosh, thank you. And since the course has a fairly nice price, I&#39;ll be buying it within the next 10 mins :D. If the lecture-quality is just as good as this one then I will definitely buy your other c# courses as soon as I&#39;m done with this one!﻿
This course is without a doubt the best introduction to C# on YouTube, this course is explained so well that you are able to retain the information unlike other courses that all ways seem to miss crucial points that could help.﻿
Although I know all this stuff for years now, I kept watching till the end, for pure enjoyment of seeing lecture done right. Amazing.﻿
Exceptional tutorial series.  Concise.  Clear.  Good pace.﻿
Gj .You won another sub :D﻿
I have plenty of questions that are going in my head and could you tell about how i make a career in web development by using C# and for which platform should i have to go with for good career growth whether in game development, desktop app or  web development. And last but not least what is C# xamarin stands for and what&#39;s its use in .NET framework. Does C# is the best language in coming years, to start with..???? i would really appreciate if you make one video on it  so that all queries would be clarified.﻿
Great tutorial thanks! Weird but when I ctrl+click on a keyword to bring up the object browser, nothing happens. I have to ctrl+alt+J to bring up the object browser, but that does not highlight the keyword selected. Any ideas?﻿
It is missing correct subtitles for Deaf programmers audience :(﻿
In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=31m34s" class="ot-anchor">31:34</a> by saying in C#, do you actually mean C# compiler? Beacuse actually C# language itself is only a specification, and it is implemented or energised in compiler.﻿
Which tools do you use for code completion?﻿
wow this is the best tutorial ever, cant believe i learned c# within an hour but i struggle a bit running the code because im using linux. but the rest was easy thanks to mosh.﻿
string is a  reference type right?﻿
is Primitive type same as Value type ?﻿
what font is in your slides?﻿
This is really good, thank you! You cover a lot more than other C# tutorials..﻿
You&#39;re great at explaining things!﻿
well done man, good work with your figures, helps visualization so well!!﻿
Thanks you are very candid at explaining things. I enjoyed your C# tutorial﻿
How long will the course be 70% off with the code? I really would like to get it for that price but it might be a few days. :/ Thank you for this video, I can not wait to dive into to C#. :)﻿
Love your videos! I&#39;m a junior programmer analyst and going through your videos kinda helped me understand a bit better how to handle the tasks I&#39;m assigned to at work. You teach better than most of my teachers in university! Wish you could have been the teacher in all my programming classes haha Keep those videos coming! Again, thank you :)﻿
Hi Mosh, it is very lucky to find such a great c# tutorial like yours! is it the complete course for your first C# basics? i want to join and learn your video course, how can i paid you and get the complete version?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m53s" class="ot-anchor">37:53</a> nothing happened.The soliution browser didn&#39;t open. Help!﻿
Thanks much for these videos..very helpful..i have few basic questions..1)is string a non primitive data type?2)class, structure and enum what kind of data type they come under primitive or non primitive3)difference between primitive and non primitive are primitive is pre defined and non primitive is user definedam I right..?thanks again﻿
Thank you for the amazing tutorials! I have only watched the first part so far, but I already feel motivated to continue unlike with other languages. I only do this as a hobby, and I currently only have very low-level programming skills for retro development only(650x family processors&#39; ASM, Z80 and Intel 8080 ASM). However, I both need to make myself tools and also take a step forward in time, and so far C# seems like a nice entry point for me :)﻿
My visual studio does not have console in it. What shall I do?﻿
I&#39;m interested in buying course on Udemy but I&#39;m Mac user.  There is no full-featured Visual Studio for Mac. Can I use Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio Code? Or will I miss a lot from course using these tools?﻿
Hey! Love the tutorial, will definitely purchase the full course. Was just wondering though, isn&#39;t it easier (generally speaking) to read the code if &quot;correct&quot; type is used instead of &quot;var&quot;? Personally i find it easier and faster to read the code with strings named string, ints named int etc. Thoughts?﻿
This is amazing... one of the best tuts I&#39;ve seen.  I will be sharing.   I would say this tho, one of the more confusing concepts for beginners is return type/output of method.  Its contradictory in description... how can something go out and return?  Return to what? LOL That tripped me up when I was getting started.﻿
Thanks so much sir﻿
+programming with Mosh will u advise to us a book for beginners(c#) ?﻿
Hey mosh i Need your help Please <br />First thanks , second iam going to buy the course , But why dont you have Tutorials<br />on &quot;Windows form &quot; or &quot;UI with buttons and textboxs ....etc&quot; I mean isnt that the important stuff !<br />when making a program its all about the UI and and the program can do ..???<br />Third , Could you Please tell me where i can get course&#39;s like that using windows form ?﻿
Great tutorial, btw pi is pronounced as pie!﻿
KInda of cool but will let yah know as tym flow﻿
As an intermediate C# programmer this is helped me a lot! Thank you!<br />In addition, I am looking for up-to-date learning material about WPF with C#, do you know where I can find any?﻿
Wow, I feel so relieved to find these tutorials. I was dead scared to start learning the language until this video. I totally understand everything you teach and more importantly increased my confidence. I&#39;m considering purchasing the extra material. Thank you for the good work﻿
Audio is so choppy it&#39;s difficult to listen to this video. Please re make it, and upload it again. Thanks!﻿
explicit﻿
Thanks a ton!! :)﻿
Hey man honestly just wanted to say the way you are teaching this, you need a job at my university 😂 well done man keep it up.﻿

Thank you for these video  it is really very helpful﻿
Good tutorial, but how can I download this video?﻿

batch is easier﻿
Ok, I enjoyed this video! Now my goal is to learn C# as well as ASP.net and learn to make a web site that incorporates a secure user login should the user want to leave comments. Is there is a better course to start this process? I would presume that learning the basics would come first. Does this course satisfy that goal?﻿
would I be able to have a decent grasp of c# within a month&#39;s time if I keep up with these videos?﻿
the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen﻿
you have only one video for c#what about non primitive type ?   Is it paid ?﻿
Thank you!﻿
&quot;90% of the stuff you see here you will never use&quot; thanks for clarifying VS in one sentence LOL.﻿
I know next to nothing about programming, so I hope these will help~ <b>Subscribes</b><br />Edit: Well I watched the whole video, and I can tell that I know much more now than I did before watching. I bought your course on Udemy. Very efficient learning so far, and I&#39;m highly considering buying the course and also requesting this tutorial to my peers if ever~﻿
This is really the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen, highly considering purchasing the course﻿
You are the best teacher ever. Hats off to you , Let me know where else I can follow you so I can tell my class fellows too.﻿
Hello, I am using a mac. My visual studio does not look like yours? Is there a reason why?﻿
I&#39;m new to learning c sharp programming. I need some help with a question﻿
Hi Mosh, I love the way you make and explain your tutorials. Do you have C++ videos ? Thanks.﻿
This is an awesome video! I am hopefully starting a Software Development course in college after the summer break, this video helped a lot! I&#39;ll be sure to recommend to my classmates.﻿
Helpful &gt;&gt;-<del>-------------------</del>&gt;﻿
can u make tutorial of games﻿
At <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m43s" class="ot-anchor">37:43</a> When you mention with Ctrl + a click, i can&#39;t get the object browser pop up about the data type var (Char)  except doing Ctrl + Alt + J but it doesn&#39;t go to the data type like you did. Help me out.﻿
Wow, finally somebody who knows how to pronounce &quot;pi&quot; correctly!  OK, that&#39;s a useless comment for your great contribution, here, Mr. Mosh.  I will try to add at least one useful thing, then:<br /><br />In the new C# 6, the string placeholders can be written like this, which can be a little cleaner:<br />Console.WriteLine($&quot;{byte.MinValue} {byte.MaxValue}&quot;)<br /><br />Cf. the example at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=39m35s" class="ot-anchor">39:35</a>.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your time and knowledge!﻿
Thank you so much this helped me sharpen my skills and knowledge in C# after programming <a href="http://VB.NET" class="ot-anchor">VB.NET</a> for 2 years. I have a job interview for a .NET Developer position on Friday and without having any professional NET Development experience and only freelance experience this really should help me. They&#39;re looking for an entry-level developer and they&#39;re well aware I don&#39;t have a college degree and that I still have stuff to learn. Hopefully I land the job. Thanks so much you&#39;ve totally eased my mind!﻿
Great Tutorials covering the scope and also details!﻿
I want to learn c sharp dear sir but how to do it﻿
it is very useful to beginner.﻿
After Learning this what more can i learn about c#?<br />To improve my c# knowledge﻿
I guess I will just take your course because jumping from video to video is exactly what I had been doing.﻿
Thank you.  I enjoyed your video. I am struggling a little with knowing how to start writing the code from scratch.  Currently I am learning to build micro services, web services, APIs, Messaging etc for the job I am in.  They have given me ample time to learn C# but I am struggling to contribute as much as I would like to.﻿
Thank you for the video. it&#39;s very helpful ! =))﻿
Thank You so much for the time efficient tips. Many programming tutorials assume that they have an audience with the same level of efficiency and therefore move far faster. You move at a reasonable pace allowing me to move alongside you and learn. Please keep up the great videos I hope you build a subscriber base so you can continue putting out free content with some kind of compensation for your time. Best of luck to you.﻿
Whats the difference with the paid video and this one if I may ask?﻿
Very professional ! and No words to explain very good in teaching ! Thanks for hard work !﻿
Hi Mosh so I am about a year out from earning my BS in Computer Science but I feel like I am still quite limited on generating code. Up this point the majority of my work has been done manipulating code, or basing projects from examples. Do you have any tips or methods on how to structure a program . I always assume it just comes with experience but it is one of my major problems coding. I&#39;d be interested in seeing some more of your courses as well can you message me some info ? Thanks This video is great by the way :)﻿
nice tutorial﻿
Isn&#39;t overflow the problem they had with Gandhi in Civilisation?﻿
Could you tell me where I could find a website where every command in C# is documented? Great video.﻿
Thank you sir Mosh!!! I&#39;ve learned alot =) =) =)﻿
Thank you sir Mosh!!! I&#39;ve learned alot =) =) =)﻿

Amazing Video... Is there going to be &quot;C# for advanced programmers&quot; ?﻿
Thank for your work.﻿
thank you so much﻿
How long is the actual course on your website?﻿
amazing lecture. but being broke i can&#39;t afford the 20$ for your coarse.﻿
Hi i need to create a windows from application can anyone direct me to a website or someone that can help me﻿
Dear Mosh, your lessons at Udemy don&#39;t have captions?﻿
You make it really easy to understand... a really great teacher... do you have JavaScript course?﻿
Although I  have advanced a bit in C# I liked the way you explained some stuffs that were new to me.  I just love you!﻿
Is this from your C# beginner course from Udemy?﻿
Thanks Mosh! great video﻿
Great﻿
I don&#39;t know anything about programming but want to learn programming. Would C # be a good starter package?﻿
Thanks, Mosh. Ease video, I do know how to code in other languages but this video, even if its basic, was pleasant to see :)<br />I&#39;m starting to learn C# because all the new UWP apps :)﻿
Amazing lecture Mosh. Thank you for sharing part of it. I will surely check your lectures at udemy. :)﻿

What do I get paying for the course for the beginner C# course .. whats the difference from this tutorial and the online course .. anyone of you guys attended this course .. seems worthy since there&#39;s so many great reviews and It&#39;s new years sale now ...﻿

Do yourself a favor and google &quot;Learn C# for beginners Microsoft&quot; and you will find a great video guide for ABSOLUTE beginners (for free, with transcripts and subtitles that actually make sense).

Need some help here.<br /><br />I want to create apps using Visual Studio but don&#39;t know how to go about doing this.  Most videos skip this step in actually getting the right hardware first.<br /><br />I&#39;m a Linux person and I&#39;m not happy with the MonoDevelop software that runs on Linux that creates Windows C# .exe files that run on a Windows machine (the final customer).  MonoDevelop has too many bugs.<br /><br />I want to get a legitimate, reasonable, and fairly priced Windows 10 operating system installation disc (I assume that will be a CD or DVD or USB thumb drive) to install on a bare-bone brand new workstation of my choice.  I want the install CD/DVDs/USB stick  because I want the capability to do a clean install in the future if I get malware/spyware/viruses on my workstation and the Defender software/anitvirus doesn&#39;t get me back to normal.<br /><br />I stopped by a local computer store and I found out....<br />1) there&#39;s no guarantee any given workstation I might custom design (or purchase from someone else) will run the Windows 10 operating system from a clean install.<br />2) you don&#39;t normally get the install Windows CDs/DVDs/USB thumb drive like you did in the Windows XP era when you buy a new workstation/laptop.<br /><br />What the heck?!<br /><br />I was expecting to buy the best hardware workstation of my choosing and do a clean install using a Windows 10 installation CD/DVD.<br /><br />I do NOT like the idea of not getting the Windows 10 install CD to do a clean install whenever I feel like it.<br /><br />I come from a Linux background whereby I buy whatever workstation hardware setup I like and then do a total clean install (wipe the entire disk space) of the hard drive and install CentOS Linux operating system and I&#39;m fine.<br /><br /><b>*</b>-How are you guys handling this without getting ripped-off/burnt and paying for stuff you don&#39;t need?<br /><br />I already have a keyboard, mouse, and HD monitor.  I just need the base unit.<br /><br />P.S. I know the difference between 32 and 64 bit specs that must be met for Linux/Windows installs, so we don&#39;t have to discuss that aspect.﻿
Ok so you have some specific settings in your visual studio? Because for me your fast mooves are not working. For ex. try+enter , ctrl+click in type.﻿

im just starting, (yesterday) only 6 hours in. Im having hard time remembering the relationships and order in which each method needs to be placed. Trying to be patient.﻿
Fantastic tutorial! Thank you so much for making this!﻿
it&#39;s vb studio 2015 ?﻿
His udemy course is too short and incomplete. Be aware!!﻿
my visual studios crashes every time i make a new project any one help???﻿
Give me a like if you are a muso who thought C# was regarding my guitars tuning alternative!! I am no longer a computer nerd,though still a nerd, maybe I&#39;ll come back to this great tutorial another day lol!!﻿
Thank you so much for this tutorial. You&#39;ve done an awesome job!! Best Regards!!﻿
are you sure this is for beginners?﻿
I can say that it is a very good tutorial and you helped us to learn too many things in such a short time and so easily.<br />Thank you very much.﻿
Do you have the next video to this?﻿
the firs code you writ (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=17m36s" class="ot-anchor">17:36</a>) didn&#39;t work for me I had to put System.Console.WriteLine instead of Console.WriteLine. ???﻿
Great tutorial. Its my habit to listen to multiple beginner tutorials when I&#39;m first starting a language, because of the different approaches each teacher has to teaching. Your mix of theory and interactivity is nearly perfect. Best beginning C# tutorial I have found online yet!﻿
About 2/3rd s of the way through and this is awesome! Considering taking your course.﻿
Awesome tutorial, thanks﻿
can i use atom editor to write c# language app﻿

Best C# for beginners on tube..﻿
Many Thanks!﻿
How much is the course, do I get a video that I can download and keep for reference, also how many courses and to what stage do you teach? Your basic video is excellent. If the rest of the course is like this then I will enjoy learning.﻿
I started my first semester in Computer Sciences and C# is our first language we learn, it&#39;s been so daunting and crazy, on top of that my teacher teaching got sick and had to be replaced by two other teachers whom have no idea how to teach it to first years as they&#39;re geared more toward 2nd and 3rd year students. I bought all 3 of your lectures on Udemy and within the first 20 minutes you have already showed me and made me understand more than i have learned in the past 3 months. Thank you so much.﻿
My visual studio has different appearance, it&#39;s with white background... how can I get the same look as yours? my eyes hurt after a while programming :/﻿
If I buy your course. Will I come back in like years and still have an access to it to refresh my memory?﻿
Clear and Appropriate... Cannot find a better tutorial for c# across the whole of youtube.... Thanks a Lot!﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m50s" class="ot-anchor">37:50</a> how do you did that ? control and what click ?﻿
This is gonna help me, im trying to develop my own program for personal reasons﻿
I went ahead and purchased you intermediate course.  Very impressed with your courses.﻿
Is there any other platform to buy your courses?﻿
Question to anyone using visual studio for mac - any reason why my terminal window doesn&#39;t pop up when I run &quot;hello world&quot;?  There are a few windows, at the bottom of visual studio, which pop up, but subsequently disappear.  It is if my program has run in silent mode (no terminal).﻿
My mac version I downloaded is a very simplified version of the Visual Studio that you use, Is there a way I can have a more advanced version of visual studio?﻿
Please say me why this code is wrong:<br />        class Gigant<br />        {<br />            public<br />                PictureBox picture=new PictureBox();<br />            public<br />                Gigant ()<br />                {<br />                    picture.Visible = true;<br />                    picture.Image = Image.FromFile(&quot;Gigant.bmp&quot;);<br />                    picture.Top = 100;<br />                    picture.Left = 100;<br />                    picture.Height = 100;<br />                    picture.Width=100;<br />                }<br />            public<br />                void walk(int x)<br />                {<br />                    picture.Top -= x;<br />                }<br />        }<br /><br />        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />        {<br />            Gigant gg = new Gigant();<br />            gg.walk(10);<br />        }<br />When I click the button1, it doesn&#39;t show anythink. The Gigant.bmp file&#39;s folder is ok.<br />Help me please!!﻿
You made it  simple thanks﻿
Nice tutorial.I got a great understanding of what to do and how to do.This video provides me a strong foundation(basement) of c# basic programming.What&#39;s next video&#39;s url .I have some problems so icannot buy the course if you have next step (<del>-</del>&gt;) of c# tutorial. please comment the url of next vide:D. If any one else know then comment it.﻿
i cant use ALt + Enter, the mean using reach?<br />@programming with mosh﻿
Where is the next video ???????﻿
Great series! Easy to follow and is logical. Thank you.﻿
super Tutorial Thanks Mosh﻿
I really cannot agree with you about using &quot;var&quot; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=36m00s" class="ot-anchor">36:00</a>).  Especially since in your own example you showed how an explicit byte can be converted to a default int. There is no reason NOT to explicitly declare them. Its even better for readability. You see it and have to guess? Or you have to hover the mouse on it? NO! Look at it and see that its declared on the left! When every one is declared (on the left) 100% you never have to guess. I wish &quot;var&quot; was not a thing!<br /><br />I can only half agree when a statement reads &quot;something name = new something(parameters)&quot; I can agree that its redundant and var could be substituted. However, if the convention of naming it on the left is more readable then still I have to disagree. The redundancy is more acceptable to keep the uniformity of declaring things on the left all the time. Just my opinion.﻿
Super good tutorial, THANK YOU SO MUCH!! :)﻿
Best ever !!!﻿
very usefull (y)﻿
where can i download   C#  ?﻿
hi.  is the tutorial accompanied by a manual or is everything on video?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=19m18s" class="ot-anchor">19:18</a><br />it&#39;s pronounced &quot;pie&quot; like the food. not pee﻿
Thanks for the video - good stuff.﻿
thank you for uploading this video........its very helpful. the way of explaining things made easy to understand.... worth purchasing ......﻿
Guess its to complicated for a 15 year old.. I do know web dev like css html javascript etc.... C# wont make sence. I&#39;ve made a ball move with arrow keys but i just wrote i never understod. Fml﻿
you need a shave!.  But it&#39;s an informative video anyway.   anyway... Pi is pronounced like PIE not PEE﻿
that &quot;try&quot; trick didn&#39;t work for me I had to write it my self (Im using VB2015)﻿
Thanks for the tutorial totally understood nd u made me feel that the language is so easy. Thanks again.﻿
it is very useful lesson thanks alot <br />but i have a question when I run the program the black window appear a second and then disappear why!!!???﻿
Mosh, will you be making an updated Asp.net core 1.0 video on Plural Sight? I really liked that first video and would love to see an updated version from yourself and a few other dev&#39;s﻿
IL is same as JVM ...? they generate both byte codesss?﻿
Great tutorial for beginners! Thanks!﻿
how do you find the min and max value using the ?:<br />plese help thanks in advance﻿
ok but why do i need to type int x = 1  if i can type Console.Writeline(&quot;1&quot;);  ???﻿

If you are interested please contact me.<br />With best regards, Evgeny.﻿
You skill are great !! Your explanation is wonderful , but the product Visula studio is not worth it.<br />I have spent 40 mins just to get here . Not user friendly at all﻿
good job bro , I am following you...#﻿
CLR: Calcium, Lime, Rust. Great for those clogged showerheads!﻿
please link next video related to c#﻿
thx for no ads. and THANK YOU for starting from the basics unlike most ppl and teacher﻿
I really enjoyed this lesson and your ways of explaining Mosh, thank you. And since the course has a fairly nice price, I&#39;ll be buying it within the next 10 mins :D. If the lecture-quality is just as good as this one then I will definitely buy your other c# courses as soon as I&#39;m done with this one!﻿
This course is without a doubt the best introduction to C# on YouTube, this course is explained so well that you are able to retain the information unlike other courses that all ways seem to miss crucial points that could help.﻿
Although I know all this stuff for years now, I kept watching till the end, for pure enjoyment of seeing lecture done right. Amazing.﻿
Exceptional tutorial series.  Concise.  Clear.  Good pace.﻿
Gj .You won another sub :D﻿
I have plenty of questions that are going in my head and could you tell about how i make a career in web development by using C# and for which platform should i have to go with for good career growth whether in game development, desktop app or  web development. And last but not least what is C# xamarin stands for and what&#39;s its use in .NET framework. Does C# is the best language in coming years, to start with..???? i would really appreciate if you make one video on it  so that all queries would be clarified.﻿
Great tutorial thanks! Weird but when I ctrl+click on a keyword to bring up the object browser, nothing happens. I have to ctrl+alt+J to bring up the object browser, but that does not highlight the keyword selected. Any ideas?﻿
It is missing correct subtitles for Deaf programmers audience :(﻿
In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=31m34s" class="ot-anchor">31:34</a> by saying in C#, do you actually mean C# compiler? Beacuse actually C# language itself is only a specification, and it is implemented or energised in compiler.﻿
Which tools do you use for code completion?﻿
wow this is the best tutorial ever, cant believe i learned c# within an hour but i struggle a bit running the code because im using linux. but the rest was easy thanks to mosh.﻿
string is a  reference type right?﻿
is Primitive type same as Value type ?﻿
what font is in your slides?﻿
This is really good, thank you! You cover a lot more than other C# tutorials..﻿
You&#39;re great at explaining things!﻿
well done man, good work with your figures, helps visualization so well!!﻿
Thanks you are very candid at explaining things. I enjoyed your C# tutorial﻿
How long will the course be 70% off with the code? I really would like to get it for that price but it might be a few days. :/ Thank you for this video, I can not wait to dive into to C#. :)﻿
Love your videos! I&#39;m a junior programmer analyst and going through your videos kinda helped me understand a bit better how to handle the tasks I&#39;m assigned to at work. You teach better than most of my teachers in university! Wish you could have been the teacher in all my programming classes haha Keep those videos coming! Again, thank you :)﻿
Hi Mosh, it is very lucky to find such a great c# tutorial like yours! is it the complete course for your first C# basics? i want to join and learn your video course, how can i paid you and get the complete version?﻿
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m53s" class="ot-anchor">37:53</a> nothing happened.The soliution browser didn&#39;t open. Help!﻿
Thanks much for these videos..very helpful..i have few basic questions..1)is string a non primitive data type?2)class, structure and enum what kind of data type they come under primitive or non primitive3)difference between primitive and non primitive are primitive is pre defined and non primitive is user definedam I right..?thanks again﻿
Thank you for the amazing tutorials! I have only watched the first part so far, but I already feel motivated to continue unlike with other languages. I only do this as a hobby, and I currently only have very low-level programming skills for retro development only(650x family processors&#39; ASM, Z80 and Intel 8080 ASM). However, I both need to make myself tools and also take a step forward in time, and so far C# seems like a nice entry point for me :)﻿
My visual studio does not have console in it. What shall I do?﻿
I&#39;m interested in buying course on Udemy but I&#39;m Mac user.  There is no full-featured Visual Studio for Mac. Can I use Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio Code? Or will I miss a lot from course using these tools?﻿
Hey! Love the tutorial, will definitely purchase the full course. Was just wondering though, isn&#39;t it easier (generally speaking) to read the code if &quot;correct&quot; type is used instead of &quot;var&quot;? Personally i find it easier and faster to read the code with strings named string, ints named int etc. Thoughts?﻿
This is amazing... one of the best tuts I&#39;ve seen.  I will be sharing.   I would say this tho, one of the more confusing concepts for beginners is return type/output of method.  Its contradictory in description... how can something go out and return?  Return to what? LOL That tripped me up when I was getting started.﻿
Thanks so much sir﻿
+programming with Mosh will u advise to us a book for beginners(c#) ?﻿
Hey mosh i Need your help Please <br />First thanks , second iam going to buy the course , But why dont you have Tutorials<br />on &quot;Windows form &quot; or &quot;UI with buttons and textboxs ....etc&quot; I mean isnt that the important stuff !<br />when making a program its all about the UI and and the program can do ..???<br />Third , Could you Please tell me where i can get course&#39;s like that using windows form ?﻿
Great tutorial, btw pi is pronounced as pie!﻿
KInda of cool but will let yah know as tym flow﻿
As an intermediate C# programmer this is helped me a lot! Thank you!<br />In addition, I am looking for up-to-date learning material about WPF with C#, do you know where I can find any?﻿
Wow, I feel so relieved to find these tutorials. I was dead scared to start learning the language until this video. I totally understand everything you teach and more importantly increased my confidence. I&#39;m considering purchasing the extra material. Thank you for the good work﻿
Audio is so choppy it&#39;s difficult to listen to this video. Please re make it, and upload it again. Thanks!﻿
explicit﻿
Thanks a ton!! :)﻿
Hey man honestly just wanted to say the way you are teaching this, you need a job at my university 😂 well done man keep it up.﻿

batch is easier﻿
Ok, I enjoyed this video! Now my goal is to learn C# as well as ASP.net and learn to make a web site that incorporates a secure user login should the user want to leave comments. Is there is a better course to start this process? I would presume that learning the basics would come first. Does this course satisfy that goal?﻿
would I be able to have a decent grasp of c# within a month&#39;s time if I keep up with these videos?﻿
the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen﻿
you have only one video for c#what about non primitive type ?   Is it paid ?﻿
Thank you!﻿
&quot;90% of the stuff you see here you will never use&quot; thanks for clarifying VS in one sentence LOL.﻿
I know next to nothing about programming, so I hope these will help~ <b>Subscribes</b><br />Edit: Well I watched the whole video, and I can tell that I know much more now than I did before watching. I bought your course on Udemy. Very efficient learning so far, and I&#39;m highly considering buying the course and also requesting this tutorial to my peers if ever~﻿
This is really the best programming tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen, highly considering purchasing the course﻿
You are the best teacher ever. Hats off to you , Let me know where else I can follow you so I can tell my class fellows too.﻿
Hello, I am using a mac. My visual studio does not look like yours? Is there a reason why?﻿
I&#39;m new to learning c sharp programming. I need some help with a question﻿
Hi Mosh, I love the way you make and explain your tutorials. Do you have C++ videos ? Thanks.﻿
This is an awesome video! I am hopefully starting a Software Development course in college after the summer break, this video helped a lot! I&#39;ll be sure to recommend to my classmates.﻿
Helpful &gt;&gt;-<del>-------------------</del>&gt;﻿
can u make tutorial of games﻿
At <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=37m43s" class="ot-anchor">37:43</a> When you mention with Ctrl + a click, i can&#39;t get the object browser pop up about the data type var (Char)  except doing Ctrl + Alt + J but it doesn&#39;t go to the data type like you did. Help me out.﻿
Wow, finally somebody who knows how to pronounce &quot;pi&quot; correctly!  OK, that&#39;s a useless comment for your great contribution, here, Mr. Mosh.  I will try to add at least one useful thing, then:<br /><br />In the new C# 6, the string placeholders can be written like this, which can be a little cleaner:<br />Console.WriteLine($&quot;{byte.MinValue} {byte.MaxValue}&quot;)<br /><br />Cf. the example at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY&amp;t=39m35s" class="ot-anchor">39:35</a>.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your time and knowledge!﻿
Thank you so much this helped me sharpen my skills and knowledge in C# after programming <a href="http://VB.NET" class="ot-anchor">VB.NET</a> for 2 years. I have a job interview for a .NET Developer position on Friday and without having any professional NET Development experience and only freelance experience this really should help me. They&#39;re looking for an entry-level developer and they&#39;re well aware I don&#39;t have a college degree and that I still have stuff to learn. Hopefully I land the job. Thanks so much you&#39;ve totally eased my mind!﻿
Great Tutorials covering the scope and also details!﻿
I want to learn c sharp dear sir but how to do it﻿
it is very useful to beginner.﻿
After Learning this what more can i learn about c#?<br />To improve my c# knowledge﻿
I guess I will just take your course because jumping from video to video is exactly what I had been doing.﻿
Thank you.  I enjoyed your video. I am struggling a little with knowing how to start writing the code from scratch.  Currently I am learning to build micro services, web services, APIs, Messaging etc for the job I am in.  They have given me ample time to learn C# but I am struggling to contribute as much as I would like to.﻿
Thank you for the video. it&#39;s very helpful ! =))﻿
Thank You so much for the time efficient tips. Many programming tutorials assume that they have an audience with the same level of efficiency and therefore move far faster. You move at a reasonable pace allowing me to move alongside you and learn. Please keep up the great videos I hope you build a subscriber base so you can continue putting out free content with some kind of compensation for your time. Best of luck to you.﻿
Whats the difference with the paid video and this one if I may ask?﻿
Very professional ! and No words to explain very good in teaching ! Thanks for hard work !﻿
Hi Mosh so I am about a year out from earning my BS in Computer Science but I feel like I am still quite limited on generating code. Up this point the majority of my work has been done manipulating code, or basing projects from examples. Do you have any tips or methods on how to structure a program . I always assume it just comes with experience but it is one of my major problems coding. I&#39;d be interested in seeing some more of your courses as well can you message me some info ? Thanks This video is great by the way :)﻿
nice tutorial﻿
Isn&#39;t overflow the problem they had with Gandhi in Civilisation?﻿
Could you tell me where I could find a website where every command in C# is documented? Great video.﻿
Thank you sir Mosh!!! I&#39;ve learned alot =) =) =)﻿
Thank you sir Mosh!!! I&#39;ve learned alot =) =) =)﻿
What is an &quot;Assembly&quot; exsactly?﻿
thank you amazing video continue﻿

Amazing Video... Is there going to be &quot;C# for advanced programmers&quot; ?﻿
Thank for your work.﻿
thank you so much﻿
How long is the actual course on your website?﻿
amazing lecture. but being broke i can&#39;t afford the 20$ for your coarse.﻿
Hi i need to create a windows from application can anyone direct me to a website or someone that can help me﻿
Dear Mosh, your lessons at Udemy don&#39;t have captions?﻿
You make it really easy to understand... a really great teacher... do you have JavaScript course?﻿
Although I  have advanced a bit in C# I liked the way you explained some stuffs that were new to me.  I just love you!﻿
Is this from your C# beginner course from Udemy?﻿
Thanks Mosh! great video﻿
Great﻿
I don&#39;t know anything about programming but want to learn programming. Would C # be a good starter package?﻿
Thanks, Mosh. Ease video, I do know how to code in other languages but this video, even if its basic, was pleasant to see :)<br />I&#39;m starting to learn C# because all the new UWP apps :)﻿
Amazing lecture Mosh. Thank you for sharing part of it. I will surely check your lectures at udemy. :)﻿
